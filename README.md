# UNICOM-UESTC
an auto program used in dorm

In UESTC, we can use WiFi suppoerted by information center in teaching area, which needs signing in only once.

However, the WiFi in dorm are offered by China Unicom & China Telecom, and the Unicom's need to sign in each time, keeping the signing in page open.

So I hope this auto signing in program can relax myself:)
